	My 32x32 Tileset – Free Edition
Version: 1.0

Tested on Unity 2025.x
(Should also work on Unity 2020.3 LTS and above, 
as it only uses PNG sprites, 2D Lights, and Particle System)
(Should also work on older versions of Unity that support 2D Tilemap and Particle System)

────────────────────────────
Contents:
- 32x32 pixel art tiles (individual PNGs)
- Full tileset (tileset.png)
- Background images (separate PNGs)
- Demo Scene (example level)
- Empty Scene (for custom use)
- Simple rain particle system
- Basic 2D light setup

────────────────────────────
How to Use:
1. Import the package into your Unity project.
2. Open DemoScene to see an example of how the assets can be used.
3. To build your own levels:
   - Use tileset.png with Unity’s Tile Palette and paint on a Tilemap.
   - Or drag the individual PNG tiles into your scene as sprites.
4. Backgrounds are located in the "Backgrounds" folder. Drag them into your scene behind the Tilemap.
5. Lighting and rain particle systems are included in the DemoScene. 
   You can copy them into your own scenes if needed.

────────────────────────────
Notes:
- This is Part 1 (Free version).
- No animations or complex materials included.
- Designed as a minimal asset pack for platformer prototypes.
- All sprites are drawn in 32x32 resolution.
